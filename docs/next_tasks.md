2. What’s Next? (Refining API Endpoints & Data)

Now that your notebook and pipeline are working, here’s how to proceed smartly:

A. Test with Real Wallets
Use fetch_wallet_data.py to pull data for wallets you know.
Run the notebook and see if the LLM’s output matches your expectations.

B. Refine API Endpoints & Data Mapping
If you notice missing, redundant, or confusing fields in the LLM output, refine:
The API endpoints (add/adjust fields, improve DTOs)
The data mapping/sanitization in fetch_wallet_data.py
The agent input schema

C. Iterate on Prompts and Output
Try different instructions and prompt formats in the notebook.
See what the LLM does well, and where it struggles.

D. Plan for Next Features
If you want structured output (JSON), add a prompt for that and parse the result.
If you want per-section analysis, try splitting the prompt and see if it helps.
If you want to automate or batch analyze wallets, script it!

3. Summary Table: Next Steps
Step	Why?
Test with real wallet data	Validate pipeline & LLM output
Refine API/data mapping	Improve quality, remove friction
Iterate on prompts/output	Get best LLM results
Add features as needed	Structured output, batch, etc.


If you want, I can help you:
Review and suggest improvements to your API endpoints/DTOs
Refine the data mapping script
Add new features to the notebook or pipeline
Just let me know what you want to focus on next!




How to Validate
Run the script for a real wallet.
Inspect agent_input.json and compare it to your schema.
If you see missing, empty, or oddly structured fields, check:
The API response (is the data there?)
The mapping (is it extracting the right field?)
8. Summary Table
Section	Mapping Quality	Potential Issues/Advice
summary	Good	Watch for camelCase/snake_case
pnl_overview	Good	Check for nested fields
behavior	Good	Check nested/complex fields
token_performance	Good	Pagination, field names
similarity	Needs endpoint	Ensure GET endpoint for results exists
Conclusion:
The mapping is correct and safe for initial testing.
Most issues will arise from API structure (field names, nesting, missing endpoints), not the script logic.
As you test, if you see missing or misaligned data, check the API response and update the mapping, not the API, unless the data truly isn’t available.
