## CRITICAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Data Reliability Assessment
**IMPORTANT**: The initial classification "Partial Flipper" has a confidence score of only 47%, indicating LOW RELIABILITY. You must re-evaluate this classification using the complete behavioral data provided.

### Classification Correction Guidelines
When `confidence_score < 0.5` (50%), treat the automated classification skeptically and analyze:
1. **Holdings Retention**: `percent_of_value_in_current_holdings` = 32.7% (HIGH retention)
2. **Time Distribution**: Only 23.5% trades under 1 hour, but 46% swing/position trades (7+ days)
3. **Trading Pattern**: 692 unique tokens across 72 days = systematic exploration, not flipping

**TRUE PROFILE**: This is a **Strategic Meme Coin Explorer**, not a "Partial Flipper"
